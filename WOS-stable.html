        <h2>Boarding</h2>
        <p>I offer premiere boarding facilities for a very low price! I currently have ~35 large stalls open for boarders, and I am working on making RSA a rank 10 stable in order to maximize the success of the boarders in the show ring! Boarders are also able to request any stable show they want and have priority over outisde stable show requests!</p>

        <h2>Breeding</h2>
        <p>I am more than happy to breed your horses for a minimal fee! RSA currently has 5 foaling stalls that are ready to be used. I am willing to breed my own horses as long as their potential partner meets or exceeds the criteria I have set for outside breedings as explained on my main page.</p>

        <h2>Riding Lessons</h2>
        <p>Do you want to find your horses' best riding settings? Send your horse over to me without changing any of the settings besides the event and I will promptly send you a message with my comments and what they mean! Make sure to send me a message when you request a lesson, or else I won't know you did so, as I do not get notifications for pending lessons!</p>
